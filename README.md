# House-price-prediction

A **Streamlit-powered web application** for predicting house prices using machine learning. Users input key property features and instantly receive a price estimate via a clean, interactive interface.

Check it out here: **[Live App Demo](https://house-price-prediction-78ynfltcobmgvgcxve9xsc.streamlit.app/)**

##  Features

-  **Interactive UI** built with Streamlit for seamless user experience  
-  **Real-time predictions**: input features and get instant price estimates  
-  **ML-backed accuracy**: uses regression model trained via robust feature engineering  
-  **Easy to extend**: modular design for new features, models, or styling  

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Streamlit** — UI and web framework  
- **scikit-learn** — Machine learning toolkit  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** — Data manipulation  
- **Pickle** — Model serialization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** — Model training, exploration & documentation

##  Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josphine1407/House-price-prediction.git
cd House-price-prediction
```
**Installation & Setup**
pip install -r requirements.txt
**Run the App Locally**
streamlit run app.py

## How It Works
1. Input
Fill in property details like number of bedrooms, square footage, location, age, etc.

2. Preprocessing
The app cleans and encodes inputs (e.g., categorical encoding, feature scaling).

3. Regression Model
A pre-trained model (model.pkl) processes the features and outputs a predicted price.

4. Display
The predicted price is shown instantly on the Streamlit dashboard in a neat format.

## Model Training (in Notebook)

The included Jupyter Notebook (model_training.ipynb) covers:

1. Data Loading & Exploration
2. Feature Engineering — handling missing values, encoding, scaling
3. Model Training — e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
4. Evaluation — metrics like RMSE, MAE, R²
5. Model Serialization — saving the trained model to model.pkl

## Future Enhancements

Add confidence intervals or probability distributions for predictions
Incorporate map-based visualization or geospatial inputs (e.g., neighborhood heatmaps)
UI makeover using Bootstrap or custom Streamlit themes
Deploy to Docker or cloud platforms (Heroku, Render, AWS Lambda)
Add explainability tools like SHAP for feature importance insights
